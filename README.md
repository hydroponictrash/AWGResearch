# AWGResearch
A repo of scientific articles about Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG's) to help other people not have to dig for hours looking for information. 
The files are meant to be imported into Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) or really any tool that can handle research articles specifically. Check the folder name for the specific version. The HTML file is basically an easy to read version if you just want the info and aren't going to import it into Zotero or any other research paper app thingy. 

# Background
I wanted to save people time from having to research all of these scientific articles and crawl around looking for them, so they are in one place. I chose articles that have information that makes it easier to make an AWG or wrap your head around how they work. Pretty soon I will take a crack at making one, specifically a passive system. This repo will be used to track my research changes and allow other people to fork the repo, add their own stuff and we can create a bunch of resources on this technology to make them, and give free water to anyone who needs it.

# Instructions 
The folders are used for Zortero (https://www.zotero.org/), once installed you can do file>>import to bring in the files. 
There is a simple HTML file included to quickly view the information.

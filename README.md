# AWGResearch
A repo of scientific articles about Atmospheric Water Generators (AWG's) to help other people not have to dig for hours looking for information. 
The files are meant to be imported into Zotero (https://www.zotero.org/) or really any tool that can handle research articles specifically. Check the folder name for the specific version. The HTML file is basically an easy to read version if you just want the info and aren't going to import it into Zotero or any other research paper app thingy.
